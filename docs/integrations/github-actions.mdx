To run Magnitude as a GitHub Action on push or PR, check out our [example repo](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude-demo-repo/blob/main/.github/workflows/magnitude.yaml):

```yaml
name: Run Magnitude Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      MAGNITUDE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MAGNITUDE_API_KEY }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Install WebSocket package
        run: npm install ws
        
      - name: Start development server
        run: npm run dev &
        
      - name: Wait for server to start
        run: sleep 5
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx magnitude
```

Your Magnitude test workers do NOT need to install Playwright or any browser, since we host those remotely for you.

So if you need to run Magnitude in any staging pipeline, it just needs to be a system that supports node.js and has `magnitude-test` installed.
