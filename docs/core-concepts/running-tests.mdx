To run your Magnitude test cases, use the CLI:
```
npx magnitude
```

## Test in Parallel
You can run your Magnitude tests in parallel simply by providing the `--workers` or `-w` flag with the desired number of parallel workers:

```
npx magnitude -w 4
```
<Info>Keep in mind this will immediately use a credit for each of the parallel test runs.</Info>

If any Magnitude test fails, the CLI process will exit with status code 1. When deployed as part of a CI/CD pipeline e.g. with a GitHub Action, this will fail the deployment.

## Test Failures

Unlike existing frameworks like Playwright, the criteria for test case failure is not based on whether a selector fails or some expression evaluates false.

Instead, Magnitude decides to fail a test case if either **(1) any step cannot be completed** or **(2) a check does not hold true**.

It will attempt to execute a test case according to the provided steps and only fail if there is no clear way to accomplish the test case, or if any check isn't satisfied.


## Local Access
Magnitude runs its browser and AI agent on our own infrastructure so you don't have to.

This means that to connect to a locally running server, we need to create a secure network tunnel for our remote browser to access it.

This is all handled automatically - just provide any local URL (e.g. `localhost:3000`) to the `url` field when creating a test case (or to `baseUrl` of config),
and when that test case is run our servers will first automatically establish a reverse tunnel to that server running on your local machine.


## Integrating with CI/CD

Testing with Magnitude in CI/CD pipelines is far easier than Playwright or Selenium, because you don't need to install or run a browser!

Magnitude hosts the browsers and AI agent which access your web application remotely - meaning no `playwright`, `chromium`, `xvfb`,
or any other sillyness has to be set up on your end-to-end testing workers.

So if you need to run Magnitude in any staging pipeline, it just needs to be a system that supports node.js and has `magnitude-test` installed.

For a specific example, check out our [example repo](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude-demo-repo) which demonstrates how to run Magnitude with [GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions).
