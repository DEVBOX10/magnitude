title: Playwright Access
description: "Reference for accessing Playwright's `Page` and `BrowserContext` objects within Magnitude tests."
---

Magnitude tests execute using Playwright under the hood. For advanced use cases or when you need direct control over the browser beyond what the `agent` object provides, Magnitude exposes the underlying Playwright `Page` and `BrowserContext` objects, accessible via `agent.page` and `agent.context`, within the test function context.

<RequestExample>
```typescript Playwright Usage Example
import { test } from 'magnitude-test';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test'; // Import Playwright assertions if needed

test('Direct Playwright Interaction', async (agent) => {
  // Use Magnitude AI for high-level steps
  await agent.act("Navigate to the product page");

  // Use Playwright 'page' object for specific checks or actions
  const pageTitle = await agent.page.title();
  expect(pageTitle).toContain('Product Details');

  const specificElement = agent.page.locator('#special-offer-banner');
  await expect(specificElement).toBeVisible();

  // 'context' can be used for browser-level operations (cookies, permissions, etc.)
  const cookies = await agent.context.cookies();
  console.log('Current cookies:', cookies);
});
```
</RequestExample>

## Test Function Context

The `testFn` passed to the `test` function receives an `agent` object:

```typescript
(agent) => Promise<void>
```

The `agent` object has the following properties:

<ResponseField name="agent.act()" type="function" required>
  The primary method for performing AI-driven actions. See [AI Steps and Checks](./ai-steps-checks).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="agent.check()" type="function" required>
  The primary method for performing AI-driven visual assertions. See [AI Steps and Checks](./ai-steps-checks).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="agent.page" type="Page" required>
  The standard Playwright [`Page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) object corresponding to the current browser tab. You can call any methods available on the Playwright `Page` API directly on this object.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="agent.context" type="BrowserContext" required>
  The standard Playwright [`BrowserContext`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) object for the current browser session. Use this for context-level operations like managing cookies, permissions, or opening new pages.
</ResponseField>

<Note>
While direct Playwright access offers maximum flexibility, prefer using the `agent.act()` and `agent.check()` methods for most interactions. This keeps tests more readable, maintainable, and leverages Magnitude's AI capabilities for resilience. Use `agent.page` and `agent.context` when specific Playwright functionality is required that isn't covered by the main `agent` methods.
</Note>

Refer to the official [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) for the full API available on the `page` and `context` objects.
