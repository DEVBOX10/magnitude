## What is Magnitude?

Magnitude is a platform for running E2E tests on web apps. It includes an SDK along with a UI dashboard.

Magnitude differs from traditional test automation frameworks in that it:
- Operates on natural language test cases as opposed to relying on DOM elements
- Uses a vision-based browser agent under the hood to execute the test cases
- Fully manages the infrastructure, meaning no Playwright or browser setup
- Stores a full history of all past test runs and results for you to reference

You can think of Magnitude as "AI-native Playwright" and it should be used in the same scenarios that Playwright would be.
Because of Magnitude's full vision-based approach, test cases remain resilient to changes in your interface without needing be updated.
