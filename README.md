End-to-end testing framework powered by visual AI agents that see your interface and adapt to any changes in it.

Available as a [hosted service](#how-to-run-your-first-test) or you can [self-host](#self-hosting) since we're open source!

## How it works
- ‚úçÔ∏è Build test cases easily with natural language
- üß† Strong reasoning agent to plan and adjust tests
- üëÅÔ∏è Fast visual agent to reliably execute runs
- üìÑ Plan is saved to execute runs the same way
- üõ† Reasoning agent steps in if there is a problem
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run tests locally or in CI/CD pipelines

## Running your first test

**1. Install our test runner** in the node project you want to test (or see our [demo repo](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude-demo-repo) if you don't have a project to try it on)
```sh
npm install --save-dev magnitude-test
```

**2. Setup Magnitude** in your project by running:
```sh
npx magnitude init
```
This will create a basic tests directory `tests/magnitude` with:
- `magnitude.config.ts`: Magnitude test configuration file
- `example.mag.ts`: An example test file

**3. Configure the Magnitude client**

For hosted, you just need a Magnitude API key. To use your own LLM providers and browser infra, see [self-hosting](#self-hosting).

You can get a free API key by signing up at https://app.magnitude.run/signup in Settings -> API Keys. Then set the `MAGNITUDE_API_KEY` environment variable:
```sh
export MAGNITUDE_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>
```

**4. Run your Magnitude tests with:**
```sh
npx magnitude
```

This will run all Magnitude test files discovered with the `*.mag.ts` pattern.

Here's an example of a basic test case:
```ts
// tests/example.mag.ts
import { test } from 'magnitude-test';

// Example URL override, defaults to configured baseUrl
test('can login with valid credentials', { url: "https://qa-bench.com" })
    .step('Log in to the app')
        .data({ username: "test-user@magnitude.run" }) // arbitrary key/values
        .secureData({ password: "test" }) // sensitive data
        .check('Can see dashboard') // natural language assertion
    .step('Create a new company')
        .data("Make up the first 2 values and use defaults for the rest")
        .check("Company added successfully");
```

Steps, checks, and data are all natural language. Think of it like you're describing how to test a particular flow to a co-worker - what steps they need to take, what they should check for, and what test data to use.

For more information on how to build test cases see [our docs](https://docs.magnitude.run/core-concepts/building-test-cases).



## Self-hosting

To run Magnitude without using our hosted option, you will need:
- Playwright and chromium installed in the environment where tests are running
  - In staging environments, installing a virtual display server like `xvfb` may also be necessary to run browsers properly in headful mode
- An Anthropic API key
- A self-hosted deployment of [Molmo 7B](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Molmo-7B-D-0924) (we are working with providers to get this available as an inference endpoint ASAP!)

### Playwright setup
The Magnitude test runner has `playwright` as an optional peer dependency when you're self-hosting and running browsers locally.
Install it in the same project as `magnitude-test`:
```sh
npm install playwright
```
You will also need to run `playwright install` and ensure browsers are installed correctly.

For staging or containerized environments, you may need to also install and run a virtual display server like `xvfb` since Magnitude runs browsers in headful mode.

### LLM configuration
Magnitude relies on two LLM models to plan and execute test cases:
1. A larger model for planning and reasoning ("planner")
2. A smaller, fast, vision capable model with pixel-perfect accuracy ("executor")

For the planner model, we strongly recommend Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 or 3.7. To get an Anthropic API key, go to https://console.anthropic.com, then set it as an environment variable:
```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
```

For the executor model, currently the only compatible models are the Molmo models by Allen AI. Specifically we recommend [Molmo-7B-D](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Molmo-7B-D-0924). Currently this model is not available through any providers, so you will need to self-host it. We recommend doing so with [Modal](https://modal.com/). To deploy Molmo with Modal see [Deploying Molmo](infra/modal). Once deployed configure these environment variables:
```sh
export MOLMO_VLLM_BASE_URL="https://<your-modal-username>--molmo-vllm-serve.modal.run/v1"
export MOLMO_VLLM_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>
```

### Running in self-hosted mode

Once everything is configured properly, you can run your tests using the same test runner, just pass the `-l/--local` flag:
```
npx magnitude -l
```
This will use your local **Playwright** installation, **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**, **MOLMO_URL**, and **MOLMO_API_KEY** instead of the **MAGNITUDE_API_KEY** and remote agent.

## FAQ

### Why not OpenAI Operator / Claude Computer Use?
We use separate planning / execution models in order to plan effective tests while executing them quickly and reliably. OpenAI or Anthropic's Computer Use APIs are better suited to general purpose desktop/web tasks but lack the speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for running test cases. Magnitude's agent is designed from the ground up to plan and execute test cases, and provides a native test runner purpose-built for designing and running these tests.
